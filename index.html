                        <p>
                            As a graduate from the University of Oklahoma, my time there has prepared me by developing
                            skills that I still value to this day. These include being able and willing to figure things
                            out when needed and understanding when to seek help, critical thinking, communication,
                            trying new things, and actively learning with an open mind. I believe that these are all
                            important traits that lead to the gateway of growth. I hope to follow through with my
                            convictions and surround myself with a like-minded team—one that pushes each other to learn
                            new things and work efficiently with each other. During my time in college, I was
                            responsible for many tasks and assignments that needed to be turned in in a timely manner.
                            In group work settings, cooperation, understanding, and teamwork were always the key traits
                            that I made sure were present in order for everybody to be successful, which is something I
                            hope to carry into the workplace if given the opportunity.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My resume illustrates a diverse career trajectory and a specialized niche in healthcare,
                            complemented by coding knowledge and training from the Springboard software engineering
                            bootcamp. There, I mastered both frontend (HTML/CSS, JavaScript ES6+, ReactJS, jQuery,
                            Axios) and backend (Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, SQL, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs)
                            technologies, alongside testing with Jasmine. I hope to put the knowledge I learned into
                            good use towards the benefit of the company.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I thrive in an environment that strives to always learn more–one that focuses on
                            self-improvement, not just as individuals, but collaboratively as a team as well. Treating
                            every day at the workplace to the fullest, especially when opportunities present themselves
                            is a motto that I personally cherish. I am confident that my skills and eagerness to create
                            align perfectly with the goals of [Company's Name], and that joining would be a good fit for
                            learning experiences towards developing the educational background that I currently have as
                            I am finally able to advance my career in the field of medical technology!
